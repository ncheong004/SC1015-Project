# SC1015-Project
This code contains the necessary EDA and Machine Learning done up by our team that enabled us to come up with a program for prospective University 
students to have a list of courses that would best suit their preferences (either salary- or passion-based).

Note: Unfortunately, as our dataset is taken off the government site, data.gov.sg, we were unable to read_html directly off the website. Alternatively, 
you can download the dataset here at https://data.gov.sg/dataset/graduate-employment-survey-ntu-nus-sit-smu-suss-sutd. Thank yoU!
